Goal: work with UVM environment without wrapper creation
- Iterate through component structure
- Option to activate Python code on testbench events
  - Phase callback on root?
  - Want something 
- Get/set fields of objects 
  - Introspect structure via UVM 'print'
  - Get/set fields via pack/unpack
  - Should 
- Create sequences via factory
- Set 'knob' fields on sequences
- Randomize and run sequences on sequencers

Side Needs:
- Better way to register static-global methods from SystemVerilog side
- Better way to call 'bare' Python async method
